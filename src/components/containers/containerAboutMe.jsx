            <p> Born and raised here in Georgia, I graduated from Mississippi State University in 2016. I started the coding
            bootcamp in hopes of expanding my horizons, and to further my opportunities in the job world. In my spare
            time, I love watching sports (specifically the Pittsburgh Penguins, Steelers, and Pirates), drawing,
            tinkering on my PC, or just spending time reading a good book. On my Portfolio page, I've included some
            coding
            homework/project links (as well as some screenshots for reference) to show relevant coding skills, as well
            as a link to my GitHub repository and my
            LinkedIn page. Also, below is a link to my resume: </p>
